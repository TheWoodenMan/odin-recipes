            I like salad, especially spinach but it can be a little bland. Well this little mixture will <strong>definitely</strong> wake up your tastebuds
        </p>
        <p>
           Works well with salads including cold meats or sausages too. 
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 tbsp Seasoned rice vinegar</li>
                <li>(or rice wine vinegar is fine too)</li>
                <li>1 tbsp Olive Oil, Extra Virgin</li>
                <li>1 tbsp Sriracha hot sauce</li>
                <li>1 tsp brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp Ground black pepper</li>
                <li>Red or white wine to taste</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            take care to stir clockwise now, this recipe can be tricky!  
            </p>

            <h2>Method:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour yourself a nice glass of wine</li>  
                <li>Mix all the other ingredients in a different glass</li>
                <li>Add to the salad and toss untl coated</li>  
            </ol>

            <p>
                <strong>Key Point:</strong> The type of Sriracha you use does actually have an impact, go with Thai. I use flying goose but any authentic brand will work.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Point:</strong> Don't substitute with other types of hot sauces. It is thicker in constistency with less chilli, more garlic and sugar.
            </p>

            <h2>Wine Suggestions</h2>
            <p>
                When you make a salad with this stuff, it has the potential to overpower many wines, so go with something that will either soothe that or alternatively - match it's power
            </p>
