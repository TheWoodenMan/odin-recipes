        <p>
           This receipe was adapted from a traditional family scottish recipe taught to me by my parents
        </p>
        <p>
           Skirlie is normally served as a side dish, but I needed some actual stuffing to go with a roast and decided to experiment

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup medium pinhead oatmeal</li>
                <li>1 medium onion</li>
                <li>&frac12; cup olive oil</li>
                <li>1 cup chopped cashew nuts</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>&frac12; tsp black pepper</li>
                <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
                <li>1 tsp sage/li>
                <li>1 tsp thyme</li>
                <li>3-4 cloves of garlic</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            The first time I made this it caused the chicken I stuffed it with to be a little undercooked requiring more time in the oven. Just bear that in mind, it's quite dense. Cooking it separately in an oven tray is better.

            <h2>Method:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Saute onions & garlic in oil on a medium heat until translucent</li>  
                <li>Add oatmeal to the mix a tablespoonful at a time, stirring and heating through </li>
                <li>add cashew nuts mixing through</li> 
                <li>add in the green herbs and stir until mixed in</li>
                <li>bake for 25-30 minutes at 180 degrees C or gas mark 5</li> 
                <li>remove from the oven when it's just starting to brown</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                <strong>Key Point:</strong> oatmeal burns really easily, you will need to stir this <strong>constantly</strong> until off the heat
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Point:</strong> Chop the cashew nuts in a blender if you like but don't go too small, you want a little crunch.

            <h2>Wine Suggestions</h2>
            <p>
               This is a stuffing so any wine that goes with roast dinner will work, lighter, jammy reds would complement the herbacious tastes or a buttery oaked white.
