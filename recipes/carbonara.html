    <h1 id="heading">üçù Spaghetti Carbonara</h1>

    <img src="../images/spaghett.jpg" width="500" alt="Bowl of Spaghetti Carbonara">
        <p>
            This recipe was originally given to me by one of my oldest Italian friends Andrea, 
            He is an absolute wizard in the kitchen and I wish I was sober enough to remember how he cooked his risotto when he last made it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fortunately, I did remember this one and through painstaking trial and error requiring multiple excuses to cook it again, here is the tried and tested version of this classic Italian dish.

            <h2>Method:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix all egg and cheese together in a bowl (preferably metal) with plenty of black pepper</li>
                <li>If you didn't think "oh maybe I put too much black pepper in" Then you need to put more</li>
                <li>Cook the pasta al dente as per instructions, with 1 tsp olive oil and 1 tsp salt in the water </li>
                <li>For spaghetti this is around 5 mins, set a timer</li>
                <li>Heat the butter in a deep pan or wok, melt but <strong>DONT</strong> let it burn. </li>
                <li>Add the garlic and pancetta, fry on a high heat until golden brown (texture like sun) </li>
                <li>Drain the pasta, saving one cup of pasta water for later</li>
                <li>Add the al-dente (remember?) pasta to the pan wth the garlic and pancetta, stir well </li>
                <li>the pasta should be coated with the oil and other ingredients, now add a splash of white wine</li>
                <li>turn the heat down to medium and add pasta water as needed, finish cooking the pasta in ths way </li>
                <li>Add the pasta, garlic, pancetta pan to the egg mix (or vice versa)<strong>Stir immediately and briskly</strong></li>
                <li>Mix through until glossy and steaming, service with grated hard cheese, black pepper and a glass of white wine</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                <strong>Key Point:</strong> This dish is heat sensitive, too much and you will scramble the eggs, too little and you will undercook them. It's a fine balance but with practice you will do well. You will probably mess this up on the first try so don't put pressure on yourself without a little practice first
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Point:</strong> Kill the heat when you transfer the pasta/pancetta to the egg/cheese mix ,the residual heat from the cooked pasta will gently cook the mixture

            <h2>Wine Suggestions</h2>
            <p>
                Carbonara is a big, rich, creamy dish with strong but bold flavours. It favours a dry, acidic but equally bold yet fruity white wine to complement it. Uncannily, many Italian white wins fit the bill.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pinot Grigio</li>
                <li>Soave</li>
                <li>Sauvignon Blanc</li>
                <li>Unwooded Chardonnay</li>
